## Title: Analyzing the Relationship Between Productivity Growth, Employment, and Wages

## Introduction:
This report examines the relationship between productivity growth, employment, and wages using the dataset "Firm Level TFP Estimates and Factor Ratios\_November\_11\_2024". We will analyze the correlation between productivity and wages per year, as well as the correlation between productivity and employment per year. The dataset includes variables such as GDP, productivity, capital, labor, year, income, country, and exchange rate.

## Methodology:
We will use correlation analysis to examine the relationship between productivity growth, employment, and wages. The analysis will be performed using statistical software, and the results will be presented in graphical form.

## Results:
Correlation Between Productivity and Wages per Year
The graph below shows a positive correlation between productivity and wages per year. As productivity increases, wages also tend to increase, suggesting that higher productivity leads to higher wages.
